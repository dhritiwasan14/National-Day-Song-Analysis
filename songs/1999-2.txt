Together

Let us be together aspire to achieve 
No matter what, no matter when, working hand in hand 
Let us go the distance, reach for goals that shine 
Creating our future, with everyone in mind 

Together we make a difference, one voice, one destiny 
We remain undivided, our hearts in harmony 
Together we make a difference, our friends, our families 
We will share a special dream, together we feel the Singapore heartbeat 

Let us find in our strides, new strength to go on by 
Nothing is ever easy, we have to hold on and strive 
Let us never be afraid, if we have to change our ways 
Through the years, we'll always stay, one in every way 

Together we make a difference, one voice, one destiny 
We remain undivided, our hearts in harmony 
Together we make a difference, our friends, our families 
We will share a special dream, together we feel the Singapore heartbeat 

In my heart lies my homeland 
I share this joy with my families and friends 
Stepping out into a New World 
As we make our choices
