Singapura, Sunny Island

Singapura, oh, Singapura,
Sunny island sets in the sea.
Singapura, oh, Singapura,
Pretty flowers bloom for you and me.
Come along join the
song in merry singing,
Blend our voices,
Join in the chorus.
Singapura, oh Singapura,
Pretty flowers bloom for you and me.

Singapura, oh, Singapura,
Sunny island sets in the sea.
Singapura, oh, Singapura,
Pretty flowers bloom for you and me.
Come along join the
song in merry singing,
Blend our voices,
Join in the chorus.
Singapura, oh Singapura,
Pretty flowers bloom for you and me.
