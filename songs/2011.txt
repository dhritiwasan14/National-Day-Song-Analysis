In A Heartbeat

I have a dream
of starting a life
I have a hope
a flame, a light
This is the moment
freedom is calling
This is my start
a new beginning
I have a heart
it beats for you
a step at a time
our spirits renew
Living togerther
under the sun
our hearts will beat as one, as one
In a heartbeat
I'll be there for you
In a heartbeat
no one else will do
In a heartbeat
we will always be
together, united, you and me
In a heartbeat
time has passed us by
In a heartbeat
we will reach the sky
In a heartbeat
this will always be
our people, our country
this is our family
We found a home
in this land
This is the place
where we can
We have a part
a role to play
it's time for us to stay...
In a heartbeat
time has passed us by
In a heartbeat
we will reach the sky
In a heartbeat
this will always be
our people, our country, this is our family
Nothing will stand in our way
We can be strong today
the flame is alive
this is our life
In a heartbeat
I'll be there for you
In a heartbeat
no one else will do
In a heartbeat
we will always be
together, united, you and me
In a heartbeat
time has passed us by
(In a heartbeat)
we will reach the sky...
This will always be
our people, our country
This is our family
