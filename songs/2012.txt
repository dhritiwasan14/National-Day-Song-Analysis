Love At First Light

First light rolls across my peaceful isle,
Mornings, I wake up, refreshed, renewed,
Ready to meet the bright new day,
So much to look forward to.
Day light, the city has stirred to life,
Your smiles put a spring in my step,
There’s a feeling that binds us one and all,
different stories, shared memories.
I love my city’s lively ways,
Warm sunny days,
Sights and sounds, special tastes that add up to this place,
I love my friends my closest ties,
Now I finally realise,
When it feels this right, you know that it’s love at first light.
Night fall, stars twinkling on the bay,
My dreams can take flight if I dare,
There’s a feeling that binds us one and all,
We look forward to a brighter day.
I love my city’s lively ways,
Warm sunny days,
Sights and sounds, special tastes that add up to this place,
I love my friends my closest ties,
Now I finally realise,
When it feels this right, you know that it’s love at first light.
Hand in hand, we’ll find new strength,
And see our dreams take flight in Singapore, Singapore.
Where ever we roam, there’s no place like home,
Come what may, we’ll be here to stay,
Now I finally realise,
When it feels this right, you know that it’s love at first light.
When it feels this right, you know that it’s love at first light.
