One Singapore

I will be here, right by your side here.
I will hold near, all that you love so dear.
Thus looking elsewhere, my life is here to share.

Just want to show I care.
I know we just got started, and I'm exicted.
This may not seem all perfect, but you know what.
Our story's just beginning, I'm gonna my alll.
Oh Yeah Yeah.

Together we can reach for the stars.
Together we are stronger as one.
Together we'll make dreams come true.
Together sharing the love with all that we do.
Let our hearts sing.

Woah-oo-woah.
Woah-oo-woah-o-woah.
Together, together as one.
We're so much more.
One singapore.
Woah-oo-woah.
Woah-oo-woah-o-woah.

It seems like so long ago, when we got started.
We wanted everything right, but you know what.
Our story keeps on going, we'll give it our all.
Together we can reach for the stars.
Together we are stronger as one.
Together we'll make dreams come true.
Together sharing the love with all that we do.

Yo! I may look like I'm just
a tiny thing
Here I am, I can bravely
sing
For sure I'm gonna give

Like how I play when that
recess bell rings
I'm gonna give it my all
Cos this is my home
I love

I love my Singapore

Let our hearts sing.
Woah-oo-woah.

Together, together as one.
We're so much more.

Let's join up the dots
Light up this spot
That we call home
Many memories and stories
to be shared
Like the colours of the
rainbow we will shine ever
so bright
Together we shine
Together we shine

Let our hearts sing.
Woah-oo-woah.
Woah-oo-woah-o-woah.
Together, together as one.
