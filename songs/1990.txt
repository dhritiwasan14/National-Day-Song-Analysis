One People, One Nation, One Singapore

We've built a nation with our hands
The toil of people from a dozen lands.
Strangers when we first begun, now we are Singaporeans 
Let's reach out for Singapore. Join our hands forevermore 

One people, one nation, one Singapore
That's the way that we will be forevermore
Every creed and every race,
has its role and has its place
One people, one nation, one Singapore
